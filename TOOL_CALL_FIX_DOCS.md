# Tool Call Parsing Fix Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the changes made to fix the tool call parsing issues in ParManusAI,
particularly focusing on handling requests like "build a webpage with trending news today".

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Tool Call Parser (pp/llm_tool_patch.py)
The tool call parser was enhanced to support multiple formats:

- **Function-style calls**: unction: tool_name(arg1="value1", arg2="value2")
- **JSON-style calls**: {"name": "tool_name", "arguments": {"arg1": "value1"}}
- **Direct URL mentions**: "go to example.com" or just "example.com"
- **Implicit search/news requests**: "search for X" or "trending news"

### 2. Improved Prompt Templates

#### In pp/prompt/toolcall.py:
- Added explicit instructions for handling news and search requests
- Clarified tool call format requirements
- Added specific examples for common use cases

#### In pp/prompt/browser.py:
- Enhanced instructions for browser interactions
- Added dedicated section for news and trending topics
- Improved examples for different tool usages

### 3. Testing Framework

Created comprehensive tests to verify:
- Direct user requests (including "build a webpage with trending news")
- AI-generated responses with various tool call formats
- Edge cases and potential parsing issues

## Verification
All tests pass, confirming that the agent now correctly:
- Recognizes requests for news and trending topics
- Properly formats tool calls for browser_use
- Handles edge cases with graceful degradation

## Next Steps
- Monitor for any missed tool calls in real-world usage
- Consider additional pattern matching improvements if needed
- Keep prompt templates updated with new examples as they arise
