ParManusAI Self-Learning Module

This module provides self-learning and self-improving capabilities for the ParManusAI agent system.

Key Components:
- SelfLearningEngine: Core learning engine that tracks performance and identifies patterns
- LearningIntegration: Integration layer for enhancing existing agents with learning
- LearningRouter: Enhanced router with learning-based agent selection
- LearningAgentFactory: Factory for creating learning-enabled agents

Features:
- Task execution tracking and analysis
- Pattern recognition from success/failure patterns
- Performance monitoring and optimization suggestions
- Continuous learning and improvement
- Self-improvement recommendations
- Learning-based routing optimization

Usage:
    from app.learning import SelfLearningEngine, enable_learning_for_agent

    # Create learning engine
    learning_engine = SelfLearningEngine()

    # Enhance an agent with learning
    @enable_learning_for_agent
    class MyAgent(BaseAgent):
        pass
